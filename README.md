## Directions to run
cd into journal-script, then: './write.sh' or './write.sh -p' to recieve prompts

Probably not very plug-and-play, though. 

## scripts? 
One script queries a weather API to tell you the temperature on the top of your .txt journal document. Just nice to know.

The other script queries my local public library (using BeautifulSoup) to see if new books I'm waiting on have been added to the system. Idea is if I journal most days, I'll catch the books being added to the system without having to like do it in the cloud.
